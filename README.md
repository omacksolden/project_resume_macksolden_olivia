# Resources
- Aside from the jQuery pugins, I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.
- jQuery Plugins
	- [The Theme Lab](http://www.thethemelab.com/thethemelab/free/10-animated-skill-bars/) - I used this plugin to create the skills bar underneath the "Education" section. This plugin animates four sliding bars to show skill level on each skill.
	- [jsSocials](http://js-socials.com/) - This plugin allowed me to add share buttons for different social network sites. On my page, this plugin is located at the very bottom underneath the "Interests" section. It was super easy to use and allows the user to choose a theme.

# Comments

For my custom jQuery, I used the toggle method to create a button that slides a ul down when clicked. When clicked again, the ul is hidden.

Overall, this assignment was interesting and allowed me to get a better handle on media queries. I was a bit confused with the screen size selection on the DevTools (iPhone, iPhone 6) versus moving the browser size but I think I got the hang of it. I think doing this assignment will definitely help me when working on the final project.
